# Anime directory project
In this project we tried to demonstrate a small project based on database management system.\
In this project we have used the real time data collected from different websites related to anime \ 
and created a local database in our srver.\
in this project we have used Mysql as our databse management system and \
python interface for the user side.\

# Description about the project
# 1. Loading the data
For loading the data we used python program to read the files from the microsoft excel and then \
write it in the mysql server.\
For connecting the mysql server to python we had used library called mysql connector.
# 2. Functions in mysql
As these function are called repeatedly we had created a function in mysql for particular demand \
from the user.\
This demand would also be recorded in order to pop up much further related functions.\
# 3. User interface
We had integrated the python user interface with mysql for display of the output.\
Which we had further built a user friendly website using danjo framework.
